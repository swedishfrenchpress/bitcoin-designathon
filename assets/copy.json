    "description": "We (the <a href=\"https://bitcoin.design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"me\">Bitcoin Design Community</a>) had a designathon! Imagine a traditional hackathon, but this time focused only on design. Our goal was to motivate designers and builders to get together and collaboratively explore ideas and concepts in and around the bitcoin ecosystem. We coordinated with the <a href=\"https://makers.bolt.fun/tournaments/1/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex\">Bolt.fun Legends of Lightning tournament</a> and <a href=\"https://2022.tabconf.com/builder-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"me\">TABConf Builder Day</a>, and chatted in Slack in the <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/bitcoindesign/shared_invite/zt-10sxfovaq-isViijl4RThKRs_TsAQnuA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"me\">#designathon channel</a>, and on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bitcoin_design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"me\">Twitter</a>.<br/><br/>It was a blast. Thank you to all participants for your creative energy and hard work. Thank you to all who helped make this event happen, especially our amazing sponsors. Check out the participating projects below."

The remainder of the event was free and open for you to explore your design creativity.<br/><br/>Next to that, there were live workshops you could join, such as how to do remote design sprints, an intro to Figma and the Bitcoin UI Kit, research, as well as some technical topics.

You could let other makers know who you are, where you were from, what skills, resources, and time you could offer, plus what you were excited to design!<br/><br/>Teams organised amongst themselves.

Has the project been transparent throughout the design journey?</p></li><li><p><b>✅ Execution</b><br/>Designers should focus on attention to detail. How well has the project executed? How strong was the design process?</p></li><li><p><b>🍒 UX/UI Design</b><br/>The design is user-centered, follows good design principles and is well-crafted.</p></li><li><p><b>🔥 Je ne sais quoi</b><br/>The design should have an extra level of pizazz, personality, creativity, or coolness.</p></li>"
